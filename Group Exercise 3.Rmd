## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
rm(list = ls())

percent = c()
min_p_list = c()

for (k in 1:100) {
  # Step 1: Simulate data from a null model
  mu = 10
  a = 20
  n = 100
  
  y_list = list()
  for (i in 1:a) {
    y_list[[i]] = rnorm(n, 0, 1) + mu
  }
  
  # Step 2: Perform pairwise comparison
  p_list = c()
  for ( i in 1:(a-1) ) {
    for ( j in (i+1):a ) {
      p_list = c(p_list, t.test(y_list[[i]], y_list[[j]], alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, var.equal = T)$p.value)
    }
  }
  
  min_p_list = c(min_p_list, min(p_list))
  
}

length(which(min_p_list < 0.05)) / length(min_p_list)
#(power-1)/-1
```
